# ESCPOS [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/escpos.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/escpos )

ESC/POS Printer driver for node

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/escpos.png?downloads=true&downloadRank=true&stars=true)](https://npmjs.org/escpos )

## Installation

### npm
```bash
$ npm i escpos --save
```

### yarn
```bash
$ yarn add escpos
```

if you use usb as an adapter :

+ On Linux, you'll need `libudev` to build libusb.
+ On Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install build-essential libudev-dev`.
+ On Windows, Use [Zadig](http://sourceforge.net/projects/libwdi/files/zadig/) to install the WinUSB driver for your USB device.

Otherwise you will get `LIBUSB_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED` when attempting to open devices.

## Example

````javascript
const escpos = require('escpos');

// Select the adapter based on your printer type
const device  = new escpos.USB();
// const device  = new escpos.Network('localhost');
// const device  = new escpos.Serial('/dev/usb/lp0');

const printer = new escpos.Printer(device);

device.open(function(){
  printer
  .font('a')
  .align('ct')
  .style('bu')
  .size(1, 1)
  .text('The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog')
  .text('敏捷的棕色狐狸跳过懒狗')
  .barcode('1234567', 'EAN8')
  .qrimage('https://github.com/song940/node-escpos', function(err){
    this.cut();
    this.close();
  });
});
````
- See `./examples` for more examples.

## Adapter

### Constructors

You can choose your adapter type as USB, Serial, Network, or Console.

#### USB(vid, pid)
```javascript
const usbDevice = new escpos.USB(0x01, 0xff);
```
vid(Vendor Id) and pid (Product Id) can be checked with the `lsusb` command or `escpos.USB.findPrinter()` method.

#### Serial("port", options)
```javascript
const serialDeviceOnWindows = new escpos.Serial('COM10');
const serialDeviceOnLinux = new escpos.Serial('/dev/usb/lp0', {
  bandRate: 14400,
  stopBit: 2
});
```
Check the [serialport package documentation](https://github.com/EmergingTechnologyAdvisors/node-serialport#serialportopenoptions--object) for more options.


#### Network(address, port = 9100)
```javascript
const networkDevice = new escpos.Network('localhost', 3000);
```
The default port number is 9100.

#### Console(handler = stdout)
```javascript
const debugDevice = new escpos.Console();
```

### Methods

#### open(function callback)

Claims the current device USB (or other device type), if the printer is already in use by other process this will fail.

By default, the USB adapter will set the first printer found .

Triggers the callback function when done.

#### close(function callback)

Closes the current device and releases its USB interface.

----

## Printer

### Constructors

#### Printer(device)

```javascript
const usbDevice = new escpos.USB();
const usbPrinter = new escpos.Printer(usbDevice);

const serialDevice = new escpos.Serial('/dev/usb/lp0');
const serialPrinter = new escpos.Printer(serialDevice);

const networkDevice = new escpos.Network('localhost');
const networkPrinter = new escpos.Printer(networkDevice);
```

### Methods

Escpos inherits its methods to the printers. the following methods are defined:

### text("text", encodeType)

Prints raw text. Raises TextError exception.

For the encode type, see the [iconv-lite wiki document](https://github.com/ashtuchkin/iconv-lite/wiki/Supported-Encodings). Escpos uses `iconv-lite` for encoding.

If the type is undefined, the default type is UTF8.

### control("align")

+ CT is the Center alignment
+ LT is the Left alignment
+ RT is the Right alignment

### size(width, heigth)

width is a numeric value, 1 is for regular size, and 2 is twice the standard size. Default: 1

height is a numeric value, 1 is for regular size and 2 is twice the standard size. Default: 1

### barcode("code", "barcodeType", width, height, "position", "font")

Prints a barcode.

code is an alphanumeric code to be printed as bar code
barcode_type must be one of the following type of codes:

+ UPC-A
+ UPC-E
+ EAN13
+ EAN8

+ ITF
+ NW7

The EAN type automatically calculates the last parity bit. For the EAN13 type, the length of the string is limited to 12, and EAN8 is limited to 7. (#57)

width is a numeric value in the range between (1,255) Default: 64
height is a numeric value in the range between (2,6) Default: 3
position is where to place the code around the bars, could be one of the following values:

+ ABOVE
+ BELOW
+ BOTH
+ OFF

Default: BELOW

font is one of the 2 type of fonts, values could be:

+ A
+ B

Default: A

Raises BarcodeTypeError, BarcodeSizeError, BarcodeCodeError exceptions.

### cut("mode")

Cut paper.

mode set a full or partial cut. Default: full
Partial cut is not implemented in all printers.

*** Don't foget this, because cut will flush buffer to printer ***
